# Creational Design Patterns

**Pattern Category:** Object Creation

---

## Description

- **Creational design patterns** focus on **how objects are created** in a flexible, reusable, and controlled manner.  
- Instead of creating objects directly using `new`, these patterns **encapsulate the creation logic**.  
- This improves flexibility, **reduces tight coupling**, and **makes systems easier to scale**.  
- These patterns define the **“when” and “how”** of object creation rather than letting the client control it.

**Key Idea:**  
> "Encapsulate object creation to make your code more flexible, maintainable, and scalable."

---

## The Problem

- Direct object creation leads to:
  - **Tight coupling** between classes and their dependencies.  
  - Difficulty changing object creation logic later.  
  - Poor scalability and maintainability.  
  - Repetition of creation logic in multiple places.  
  - Harder testing and configuration.

---

## The Solution

- Use **specialized patterns** to manage how objects are created.  
- Abstract the object creation logic from the client.  
- Make systems more flexible to change.  
- Promote **loose coupling** between components.  
- Make it easier to switch implementations, add new products, or configure objects dynamically.

## Code Flow Explanation

**What This Overview Does:**  

- Provides a structured guide to all major creational patterns.  
- Explains their purposes, scenarios, and when to use each one.  
- Serves as a **roadmap for implementing creational design patterns** effectively.  
- Helps create flexible architectures where object creation logic is centralized and well-organized.

## Step-by-Step Pattern Guide

### 1. Singleton Pattern (`singleton/`)
- **Purpose:** Ensures only one instance of a class exists and provides a global point of access.  
- **Key Idea:** Restrict instantiation and control access to the single object.  
- **Use Case:** Configuration managers, logging, caches, thread pools, connection pools.  

### 2. Factory Method Pattern (`factory-method/`)
- **Purpose:** Define an interface for creating objects, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.  
- **Key Idea:** Delegates object creation to subclasses.  
- **Use Case:** When a class cannot anticipate the type of objects it must create.

## Real-World Example: Configuration Management

Imagine building a large system that:

- Has multiple objects that need controlled creation.  
- Requires single points of access for certain components.  
- Needs to manage families of related objects consistently.  
- Needs flexible ways to construct complex objects.  

**Without Creational Patterns:**  
- Repetitive code, tight coupling, and rigid architecture.  

**With Creational Patterns:**  
- Flexible, maintainable, and scalable system.  
- Centralized object creation logic, easier testing, and clear object relationships.

---

## Benefits

- **Flexibility:** Object creation logic can change without affecting client code.  
- **Maintainability:** Centralized and organized creation logic.  
- **Reusability:** Patterns allow reusing creation mechanisms.  
- **Testability:** Easier to mock or replace objects in tests.  
- **Scalability:** Adding new product types or changing creation logic is easier.

---

## Use Cases

- **Large Software Systems:** Maintainable object creation.  
- **Framework Development:** Configurable and extensible APIs.  
- **Game Development:** Creating many similar objects with minor variations.  
- **Database Connection Management:** Singleton connection pools.  
- **Complex Object Construction:** Builders for objects with multiple optional parameters.

---

## Drawbacks

- **Complexity:** May add extra layers of abstraction.  
- **Learning Curve:** Requires understanding multiple patterns and when to use them.  
- **Over-Engineering:** Can be overkill for simple object creation.  
- **Performance:** Some patterns introduce slight overhead.  
- **Debugging:** Indirection in creation logic may complicate debugging.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Encapsulation of Creation Logic:** Avoid scattering object creation throughout code.  
- **Loose Coupling:** Clients depend on interfaces, not concrete classes.  
- **Single Responsibility:** Each pattern has a clear purpose in object creation.  
- **Choose Wisely:** Use the simplest pattern that solves your problem.  
- **Flexibility and Reuse:** Patterns make systems easier to extend and maintain.
